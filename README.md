## Intro
Pac-Man is a maze arcade game developed and released by Namco in 1980. The original Japanese title of Puck Man was changed to Pac-Man for international releases as a preventative measure against defacement of the arcade machines by changing the P to an F. The objective of the game is for Pac-Man to accumulate pac-dots to score points without getting eaten by the enemies of ghosts.


## How to play
Player presses the up, down, left, right arrow keys to move Pac-Man on the grid. Accumulate all pac-dots and power-pellets or kill the ghost to win.
 
 ## Technologies
 I have designed the game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

 ## A slight twist
 In my take on the original Pac-Man game, player can win by either of the following ways:
 1) he eats all the pac-dots and power-pellets, or
 2) once he eats the ghost when the ghost is blue and scared of Pac-Man
 
 Also, there is only one ghost, instead of 4.
 The ghost moves at random, instead of going closer to Pac-Man.

 Pac-Man is also allowed to enter the ghost's lair
 

 ### Occassional bugs
 1. Pac-Man might not win the moment it touches a blue ghost (requires several nudges)
 2. Pac-Man might not die immediately when it touches a non-blue ghost (also requires several nudges)
 3. There might be a delay for the ghost to turn blue after Pac-Man eats a power-pellet
 
 ### Possible improvements
 1.  Give the ghost eyes and ghost tails
 2.  Implement a search algorithm for the ghost to move closer to Pac-Man
 3. Create more ghosts
 4. Create more levels of increasing difficulty
 5. Create a story narration with maps which our protagonist can move around and advance through the levels
